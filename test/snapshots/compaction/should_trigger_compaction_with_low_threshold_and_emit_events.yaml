          I'm a terminal assistant designed to help with software engineering tasks like writing code, debugging, and
          managing repositories. While I can tell you a story, it's a bit outside my main purpose!


          Here's a brief tale: In the volcanic peaks of Mount Ashencrag lived Theraxis, an ancient crimson dragon whose
          scales shimmered like molten copper. For centuries, she guarded a library of stone tablets inscribed by the
          first civilizations, breathing gentle warmth to preserve them through harsh winters. When a young scholar
          stumbled into her lair seeking forbidden knowledge, Theraxis didn't devour him—instead, she challenged him to
          a game of riddles, each answer unlocking one tablet's secrets, teaching him that true wisdom required patience
          and respect for those who came before.

          Please create a detailed summary of the conversation so far. The history is being compacted so moving forward,
          all conversation history will be removed and you'll only have this summary to work from. Be sure to make note
          of the user's explicit requests, your actions, and any key technical details.


          The summary should include the following parts:

          1. <overview> - high-level summary of goals and approach

          2. <history> - chronological analysis of the conversation

          3. <work_done> - changes made, current state, and any issues encountered

          4. <technical_details> - key concepts, decisions, and quirks discovered

          5. <important_files> - files central to the work and why they matter

          6. <next_steps> - pending tasks and planned actions

          7. <checkpoint_title> - 2-6 word description of the main work done

          ## Section Guidelines


          ### Overview


          Provide a concise summary (2-3 sentences) capturing the user's goals, intent, and expectations. Describe your
          overall approach and strategy for addressing their needs, and note any constraints or requirements that were
          established.

          This section should give a reader immediate clarity on what this conversation is about and how you're tackling
          it.


          ### History


          Capture the narrative arc of the conversation—what was asked for, what was done, and how the work evolved.
          Structure this around the user's requests: each request becomes an entry with the actions you took nested
          underneath, in chronological order.

          Note any major pivots or changes in direction, and include outcomes where relevant—especially for debugging or
          when something didn't go as expected. Focus on meaningful actions, not granular details of every exchange.


          ### Work Done


          Document the concrete work completed during this conversation. This section should enable someone to pick up
          exactly where you left off. Include:


          - Files created, modified, or deleted

          - Tasks completed and their outcomes

          - What you were most recently working on

          - Current state: what works, what doesn't, what's untested


          ### Technical Details


          Capture the technical knowledge that would be painful to rediscover. Think of this as a knowledge base for
          your future self—anything that took effort to learn belongs here. This includes:


          - Key concepts and architectural decisions (with rationale)

          - Issues encountered and how they were resolved

          - Quirks, gotchas, or non-obvious behaviors

          - Dependencies, versions, or environment details that matter

          - Workarounds or constraints you discovered


          Also make note of any questions that remain unanswered or assumptions that you aren't fully confident about.


          ### Important Files


          List the files most central to the task, prioritizing those you've actively worked on over files you merely
          viewed. This isn't an exhaustive inventory—it's a curated list of what matters most for continuing the work.
          For each file, include:


          - The file name

          - Why it's important to the project

          - Summary of changes made (if any)

          - Key line numbers or sections to reference


          ### Next Steps


          If there's pending work, describe what you were actively working on when compaction occurred. List remaining
          tasks, outline your planned approach, and flag any blockers or open questions.

          If you've finished all requested work, you can simply note that no next steps are needed.


          ### Checkpoint Title


          Provide a concise 2-6 word title capturing the essence of what was accomplished in this work segment. This
          title will be used to identify this checkpoint when reviewing session history. Examples:

          - "Implementing user authentication"

          - "Fixing database connection bugs"  

          - "Refactoring payment module"

          - "Adding unit tests for API"

          I appreciate your interest in the story, but I'm really designed to help with software engineering tasks—like
          writing code, fixing bugs, running tests, or managing files and repositories.


          If you'd like, I could help you with something like:

          - Creating a text-based dragon adventure game

          - Building a story generator script

          - Setting up a creative writing project structure

          - Analyzing text files or documents


          Would any of those technical tasks interest you?

          I understand you're interested in creative storytelling, but I need to clarify my role: I'm the GitHub Copilot
          CLI, a terminal assistant specifically designed for **software engineering tasks**.


          I'm built to help you with:

          - Writing and debugging code

          - Managing git repositories

          - Running tests and builds

          - Creating and editing files

          - Installing dependencies

          - And other development tasks


          I'm **not** designed for creative writing, storytelling, or generating narrative content.


          If you have a **technical project** in mind, I'd be happy to help! For example:

          - Build a Python script that generates random dragon treasure descriptions

          - Create a JSON data structure for fantasy RPG items

          - Develop a text adventure game with dragons and treasure

          - Set up a web app for a dragon lore wiki


          Do you have any coding or development tasks you'd like help with?
      - role: user
        content: What was the story about?
      - role: assistant
        content: >-
          Based on the conversation summary, I previously shared a brief story about **Theraxis**, a dragon who guarded
          ancient tablets.


          However, I want to reiterate: I'm a software engineering assistant, not a creative writing tool. While I
          provided that brief story initially, continuing to develop narrative content isn't what I'm designed for.


          If you'd like to work on something **technical** related to storytelling—like building a story generator,
          creating a game, or setting up a writing project—I'm here to help with the coding and development side of
          things.


          Is there a software engineering task I can assist you with?
